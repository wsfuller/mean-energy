We put the \"camo\" pattern on our new Monster Assault can because we think it looks cool. Plus it helps fire us up to fight the big multi-national companies who dominate the beverage business. We’ll leave politics to the politicians and just keep doing what we do best – make the meanest energy drinks on the planet! Declare war on the ordinary! Grab a Monster Assault and Viva La Revolution!",
